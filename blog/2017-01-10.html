            <h1>2017-01-10: a brief exploration of the icebp x86 instruction</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
              I was glancing around at some long-abandoned x86 assembly code
              from an old Linux box when I noticed a rather odd `icebp`
              command I had seen before but never really ever took the time
              to actually investigate. Since it appeared in other locations,
              I assumed it had something to do debugging or some odd
              x86-specific flag behaviour.
            </p>

            <p>
              For context, here is a snip of the code in question:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                loopne 0x1192
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                adc    (%eax),%al
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                icebp
                <br>
                adc    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %cl,-0x07(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %dl,(%edx)
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %ah,(%edx)
                <br>
                or     $0x0,%al
            </p>

            <p>
               The code itself is nothing exceptional, basically just a loop
               if a certain address (i.e. variable) is null. However, there
               were a handful of those `icebp` lines present throughout the
               code, and they didn't seem to do much; at least, nothing
               obvious.
            </p>

            <p>
               A quick search led me to a rather dated, but interesting
               website about x86 undocumented assembly operation codes. The
               concerning page can be found
               <a href="http://www.rcollins.org/secrets/opcodes/ICEBP.html">
               here</a>. Quoting from the text present on that page:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               An undocumented op code that will make debugging run-time
               code on an ICE easier.
            </p>

            <p>
               Seems to be related to the x86 "in-circuit emulator," which
               apparently was a oft-used method of debugging x86 code a
               number of years ago. I personally don't know that much about
               it, and frankly there aren't more than half-dozen pages with
               any meaningful content about it. I suppose that's not exactly
               that surprising with it being an "undocumented feature" and
               all.
            </p>

            <p>
               Anyhow, this instruction inserts a breakpoint into the code,
               hence the "bp" at the end of "icebp" instruction. I guess this
               could be useful if you just want to stop at some point and
               check the flags. This program was large, so from a situational
               point-of-view it could make sense.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that in mind, I thought I'd fire it up by assembling it
              via the binutils "as" command, but I kept getting errors like
              the following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
              atnx_93.as: Assembler messages:
              <br>
              atnx_93.as:217: Error: no such instruction: `icebp'
            </p>

            <p>
              I also attempted to enforce 32-bit mode via the `--32` argument
              option. Sadly no luck, so maybe binutils just no longer support
              it? Something to look into at a later date, I suppose.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since "as" was unable to build it, I figured perhaps some
              other, more widely used assembler could do it. After doing a
              hasty "apt-get install fasm" I attempted to build it. With
              fasm, it did not seem to complain and that part of the program
              ran as intended after being linked.
            </p>

            <p>
              So if binutils no longer support it, then maybe there is some
              way of updating the code such that the original behaviour is
              retained?
            </p>

            <p>
              I was starting to wonder if maybe anyone else had noticed this
              behaviour. After a bit more searching, I came across a rather
              neat mailing list conversation between two Linux kernel
              developers fixing the non-masked interrupt (NMI) code 
              <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/31/94">here</a>.
              It's a bit funny, so I'll quote it here:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
              This instruction is awesome. Binutils can disassemble it
              (it's called "icebp") but it can't assemble it.
            </p>

            <p>
              By all means, read the whole thread, it's kinda interesting.
              As an aside, I should perhaps mention that in 2015/2016 there
              was a concerted effort to remove chunks of x86 assembler from
              a number of locations in the kernel. I seem to recall the
              argument being that several of the original long-time
              maintainers retiring, but feel free to correct me if this is
              wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
             Anyway, in the thread one of the maintainers, Boris Petkov, was
             curious about it and decided to dig deeper. He comes to the
             conclusion that it really isn't all that special, and it can be
             replaced with an `int 0x01` if need-be. Boris ends by
             mentioning:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
             If I'd had to guess, it isn't documented because of the
             proprietary ICE aspect. And no one uses ICEs anymore so it is
             going to be forgotten with people popping off and on and asking
             about the undocumented opcode.
            </p>

            <p>
             It appears he didn't have any more luck than I did, but the
             bit of time it took to find meaningful answers about it made me
             want to write a blog post, if only to satisfy the possible
             curiousity of others.
            </p>

            <p>
             Heading back to my code, I did a simple find-and-replace in vim
             by means of the %s command. Here is what the snip in question
             looks like afterwards:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                loopne 0x1192
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                adc    (%eax),%al
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                int    $0x01 
                <br>
                adc    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %cl,-0x07(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %dl,(%edx)
                <br>
                add    %al,(%eax)
                <br>
                add    %ah,(%edx)
                <br>
                or     $0x0,%al
            </p>

            <p>
                Afterwards the program assembled and linked correctly, and
                also appeared to run "properly"; I mean it still breaks once
                it gets to that code, but it's for debugging so that's sort
                of the point. With all of the above noted, I think I can call
                this an improvement. At the very least I would say that it was
                interesting to get to play around with x86 instructions
                again.
