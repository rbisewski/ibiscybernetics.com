            <h1>2017-01-26: examining golang binaries and upx compression</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
               Even though C is and continues to be a favourite language
               of mine for a number of years, lately I'm been somewhat
               interested in any alternatives that might actually be
               available.
            </p>

            <p>
               Ideally, in situations that call for performance, yet without
               the need to write an entire strings library or harness the
               libboost stack-and-friends. A popular one that comes to mind
               is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>. That said,
               after glancing at the sort of unique methodology that would
               be demanded from it, I decided that at least for the time
               being I would prefer to pick a language that more closely
               matches the C-style syntax I am familiar with.
            </p>

            <p>
               As an aside, since I have a bit of experience as
               a browser developer, perhaps I'll look into Rust another time
               if I ever want to play around with the
               <a href="https://servo.org">Servo engine</a> code. I'll hold
               off on that until some future date, I think.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Now one of more widely used languages these days is Google's
               latest and greatest, the golang programming language. A
               number of larger players in the industry (even outside of
               Google!) attest to its utility and speed, most notably Amazon.
               So I felt taking a bit of time to look into this was
               warranted.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               To get a feel for the syntax, I hastily wrote a small hwmon
               temperature program, you can find it
               <a href="https://github.com/rbisewski/tempchk">here</a>,
               which grabs data from the relevant Linux system directories,
               as per the 4.0-4.8 series of kernels. After a run of the
               `go build` command to compile, I found it produced binaries
               that were rather on the big side, at least in my opinion.
               Roughly 2.5MB for a small 260 line program, which merely
               reads from files and prints the numerical value to stdout.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               I began my investigation into this using the `strings`
               commandline util to see if I could obtain any unencoded
               symbols from the binary. This ended up outputting about half a
               megabyte of various subroutine names from each of the imported
               files.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Even saw a couple of hardcoded locations embedded in the
               debug portion of the file, specifically this:
            </p>
               
            <p class="grey_monospace">
               /usr/lib/go-1.6/src/runtime/runtime-gdb.py
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Ah, nothing better than binaries exec'ing script files.
               Best of all, a Python script. Nothing could possibly go
               wrong. Admittedly, this gets utilized only during
               debugging, but still...
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Switching over to objdump, I went ahead and gleened the
               binary. It was actually fun to look at. Here is a peek:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
               mov    0x18(%rsp),%rbp
               <br>
               cmp    %rbp,%rax
               <br>
               jge    4029d1 &#60;type..hash.[3]interface {}+0x71&#62;
               <br>
               mov    %rax,0x20(%rsp)
               <br>
               mov    0x30(%rsp),%rbx
               <br>
               cmp    $0x0,%rbx
               <br>
               je     4029db &#60;type..hash.[3]interface {}+0x7b&#62;
               <br>
               mov    %rax,%rbp
               <br>
               shl    $0x4,%rbp
               <br>
               add    %rbp,%rbx
               <br>
               mov    %rbx,(%rsp)
               <br>
               mov    %rcx,0x38(%rsp)
               <br>
               mov    %rcx,0x8(%rsp)
               <br>
               callq  403100 &#60;runtime.nilinterhash&#62;
            </p>
               
            <p>
               That's part of the golang hash implementation, which is
               pleasantly well symbolled, likely to make x86-64 debugging
               easier. Much easier to look at than the old 16/32bit x86
               codes, but it does sorta confirm the binaries are filled
               with literal multitudes.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Anyway, with this in mind, a quick search online suggests 
               that I am not alone in my examination of golang and its
               beefier binaries, notably mentioned
               <a href="https://donatstudios.com/Golang-Binary-Sizes">here</a>,
               <a href="https://jamescun.com/golang/binary-size">here</a>
               and
               <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24126398/why-does-go-produce-big-binary-files-for-small-programs">here</a>.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               As surmised from the volume of symbols present in the binary
               and confirmed by StackOverflow, golang is indeed statically
               linked with a number of libraries. This explains all of the
               above.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               I also noticed that David Crawshaw, one of the language
               authors, is aware of the current situation, and has actively
               worked on solving it in the newer
               <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.7-binary-size">1.7 and 1.8 versions</a>
               of golang.
            </p>

            <p>
               Improvements on that front are always nice, especially the
               inclusion of method pruning and reflection during the
               compilation. Still, it does make me wonder how many golang
               binaries are floating around out there with plaintext 
               or easy to reverse engineer content like the aforementioned.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Back on point, most machines likely have no issue with
               sizable applications on their hard drives, but I figure
               it couldn't hurt to check if some easy method exists to
               improve this.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               With a little bit of searching around online, I noted two
               particular argument
               <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/shrink-your-go-binaries-with-this-one-weird-trick">flags</a>.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Filippo Valsorda mentions that go-build actually offers a
               symbol stripper which can be accomplished in the following
               fashion:
            </p>
               
            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
               go build -ldflags="-s -w"
            </p>   
               
            <p>
               That shrunk the binary from 2.5MB to 1.7MB, so an improvement
               of a sort. As noted on the blog post, I can confirm it's
               mostly stripping the debug section, which is probably a good
               thing, but really not that amazing overall. 
            </p>   
               
            <p>
               Filippo then goes on to use UPX, which is a pretty neat binary
               packer, but it does mean you have to agree to their slightly
               restrictive
               <a href="https://upx.github.io/upx-license.html">license terms</a>.
               Yet it does reduce my particular binary to a size of
               531kB, which means I can now technically drag it around on a
               floppy; a fairly staggering achievement for 2017!
            </p>   
               
            <p>
               UPX uses an LZMA-like lossless compression algorithm called
               UCL, since they wanted the end-users to decompress it as well.
               Ah, but before I do that, I think it might be worthwhile to
               take a glance at the
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_coder">substitution coder table</a>
               for fun, which you can see below:

               I tend to find they're interesting and nifty to look at,
               since they give a concrete idea of what "lossless"
               compression means; basically a kind of fancy hash array.
               Also notice how the table is terminated by means of ten 9999
               and ten NNNN characters.
            </p>   
               
            <p>   
               Going back to the binary itself, it was good to see that the
               symbols had more or less been dealt with, aside from obvious
               watermark footer embedded in the file:
            </p>
               
            <p class="grey_monospace">
               $Info: This file is packed with the UPX executable packer

            <p>   
               After compression, objdump had difficulty, which makes sense
               given it's now a compressed archive for all practical
               purposes.
            </p>
               
            <p>   
               Well, that concludes my brief exploration of golang binaries
               and an overview of UPX. I might consider doing another
               investigation once golang 1.8 arrives and is more widely
               available.
