            <h1>2017-02-04: exploring the Solus Linux distro</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
               I've been a Linux user for quite a number of years now, and
	       am always readily impressed by the volume of Linux distros that
	       rise and fall.
            </p>

            <p>
	       For the longest time I was using
               <a href="https://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a>. However,
	       at least for a while, Patrick Volkerding and the other
	       Slackware developers seemed to have been publishing
	       far fewer releases, giving me the impression that they were
	       winding down or had moved on to other projects. This
	       was mostly between 2009-2015 I recall, but I think they've
	       since restarted development. Good luck to them I suppose,
	       yet I have since moved on.
            </p>

            <p>
	       I played around with 
	       <a href="https://www.opensuse.org">openSuSE</a> after leaving
	       the Slackware camp. Mainly this was due to the more bleeding
	       edge functionality, notably on the graphics side of things.
	       The very early Gallium variants of Mesa libs were especially
	       fun, often breaking but *still* providing a better experience
	       than the pre-existing drivers.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Regarding other distros, 
	       <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> was not bad in my
	       opinion, but it never really caught my attention. I can't
	       recommend it outside the enterprise-market variants (e.g.
	       CentOS / RHEL and the like).
            </p>
               
            <p>
	       Eventually due to the popularity of
	       <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, it only made sense to
	       give it a shot. I had tested it before in the past, but it
	       never seemed it exciting. However, the ease of installing and
	       updating Radeon graphics drivers was nice, given the mess that
	       the fglrx driver had been for a number of years.
            </p>
               
            <p>
	       On a related note, the new amdgpu and amdgpu-pro Radeon
	       drivers in late 2016 have been quite excellent, so I'll
	       admit the other Linux distros are looking better again.
            </p>

            <p>
	       Personally, I have not done much in the way of distro hopping
               lately, but since my reasons for sticking with Ubuntu have
	       gone away, I figured I would try
	       <a href="https://getsol.us/">Solus</a>. The neatly
	       designed GUI and rolling distro aspect of it intrigued me,
	       so I decided to give it a shot.
            </p>

            <p>
	       To give an overview of this particular distro, it seems like
	       it utilizes GTK3 libraries for the window-manager, which is
	       called "Budgie" and borrows a little from Gnome and MATE, but
	       is otherwise an entirely different design. The package
	       manager is called "eopkg" which is derived from the
	       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardus_(operating_system)#PiSi_package_management">PiSi</a>
               package manager in the now abandonned distro of Pardus.
	       Nothing too special on the functionality side of things,
	       but the LZMA compression is a nice touch.
            </p>

            <p>
	       Not much in the way of guides currently on the internet for
	       this distro, and the overall structure of the OS is a bit
	       different from standard deb / rpm distros so I think a
	       brief overview of some of the commands is in order.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
	       #
	       <br>
	       # Search for a given package
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
               eopkg sr package-name
	       <br>

	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
	       # Install a given package
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
               eopkg it package-name 
	       <br>
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
	       # Remove a given package
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
               eopkg rm package-name 
	       <br>
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
	       # Admin access the software centre
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
               sudo solus-sc
	       <br>
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
	       # Examine the current boot settings 
	       <br>
	       #
	       <br>
               sudo bootctl status
            </p>

            <p>
	       In addition, it seems that Solus is one of the few Linux
	       distros that relies solely on the systemd boot subsystem,
	       via a fork of gummiboot called 'goofiboot'. In order to
               customize the boot menu, rather than update-grub, the EFI
	       loader file needs to be editted. This can be accomplished
	       as follows:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               sudo vi /boot/efi/loader/loader.conf
            </p>

            <p>
	       A few other interesting aspects of this OS set it apart from
	       the current crop of Linux GUIs, so I figure going over them
	       quickly might be worthwhile to anyone reading:
	       <ul>
	          <li>
		     <span>
                     To adjust the position of the top bar or customize
		     the theme, click on the "door" icon at the right-most
		     to access the Raven control panel.
		     </span>
	          </li>
	          <br>
	          <li>
		     <span>
		     To view alerts or system updates, click on the "bell"
		     icon at the right-most part of the screen.
		     </span>
	          </li>
	          <br>
	          <li>
		     <span>
		     To install some of the third-party software, you'll
		     need to do a `sudo solus-sc` to force it into admin
		     mode. Otherwise occasionally the "Requires Auth"
		     dialog doesn't trigger as one might expect.
		     </span>
	          </li>
	       </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
	       Finally, this distro is a bit on the minimalist side, so
	       be warned that you can expect fewer repos and packages.
	       Probably less support as well, so at this time I'd recommend
	       it as a sort of end-user distro, preferly a user with more
	       experienced as it is, after-all, a rolling distro (e.g.
	       potential package requirements breakage, missing symlinks,
	       and more overall weirdness).
            </p>

            <p>
	       The above noted, I am at this time mostly pleased with the
	       current level of functionality in Solus. Hopefully it
	       continues to remain popular, as I rather like the idea of a
	       fast rolling desktop OS.
