            <h1>2017-04-05: first glance at the gnu parallel utility</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                During a discussion I had the other day with a sysadmin, I
                heard about this neat tool I had never used before, called
                <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU
                    Parallel</a>, which allows a simple terminal way of
                executing multiple commands on one or more machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                It accepts arguments similar to those of xargs, which means
                potentially it can be an elegant drop-in replacement for
                situations where fiddling around with pipes will get the job
                done. That said, parallel has a great deal of arguments, making
                it seemingly a flexible program.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an aside, I suppose the pythonic method of doing something
                like this would be <a href="http://fabfile.org/">fabric</a>,
                which is fairly impressive as well. Plus it has been around
                long enough that it has grown into a mature library.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, I was intrigued by the idea of getting parallel to
                work in a similar fashion, at least for the purposes of
                executing commands on multiple instances.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before doing that though, I think a quick overview of
                parallel and its syntax is warranted. Let's begin...
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               parallel
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon doing so a warning appears, or at least on the
                Debian docker image being used for this example:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               parallel: Warning: Input is read from the terminal. Only
               experts do this on purpose. Press CTRL-D to exit.
            </p>

            <p>
                I think the newer versions have a slightly different
                warning message. On my Solus desktop I got the following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                parallel: Warning: Input is read from the terminal. You either
                know what you
                <br>
                parallel: Warning: are doing (in which case: YOU ARE AWESOME!)
                or you forgot
                <br>
                parallel: Warning: ::: or :::: or to pipe data into parallel.
                If so
                <br>
                parallel: Warning: consider going through the tutorial: man
                parallel_tutorial
                <br>
                parallel: Warning: Press CTRL-D to exit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regardless, this is good advice as parallel will attempt
                to run each line as a single process, with one job per CPU,
                as the default. So a bit of caution ought to be exercised
                and a quick read over the man page is recommended.
            </p>

            <p>
                Assuming that the reader is indeed in a safe environment
                with sufficient permissions, trying typing the following
                into the parallel terminal.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                lscpu
                <br>
                lsblk
                <br>
                pwd 
            </p>

            <p>
                Be sure to hit enter at the end of each line, as \n is the
                default job separator. Finally end the session by pressing
                CTRL-D. Afterwards you'll get the CPU info, block device
                info, and a print of the current working directory.
            </p>

            <p>
                Not too shabby, but not actually better than bash yet. The
                utility itself has a fairly nifty syntax, reminiscent of
                `find` in some ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                A more gruelling practical example might be trying to
                decompress the contents of a number of bz2 archives into
                their own separate folders simultaneously. With parallel
                this becomes an elegant one-liner.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                parallel 'mkdir {.}; mv {} {.}; bunzip2 {.}/{};' ::: *.bz2
            </p>

            <p>
                Which is pretty nice and each archive is decompressed on a
                separate CPU core. Yet a fancy bash or perl script could
                still, in theory, be used in its place.
            </p>

            <p>
                How about getting parallel to ssh and execute commands on
                multiple machines? To accomplish this, parallel reads data
                in from a file located in its config directory, which is
                located in...
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                ~/.parallel/sshloginfile
            </p>

            <p>
                Below is a sample file to give you an idea of how this
                works.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                #
                <br>
                # Assign one core for user "gill" on host "192.168.2.26"
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                1/gill@192.168.2.26
                <br>
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                # Assign four cores for user "john" on host "192.168.4.174"
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                4/john@192.168.4.174
                <br>
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                # Assign two cores for user "nate" on host "192.168.5.231"
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                2/nate@192.168.5.231
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider reading the man page for more details, but once
                that is all filled in with the details of your local
                network machines or cluster, running quick commands on
                them is a bit of breeze. Maybe you need to check uptime?
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                parallel -S .. 'hostname; uptime' ::: ..
            </p>

            <p>
                Afterwards the current uptime of the specified machines
                will be printed to stdout. Note that parallel seems to
                have a bit of difficulty handling keys and passphrases
                natively. The man page suggests instead that the user
                run sshpass or ssh-agent to function as a sort of
                middleman.
            </p>

            <p>
                Adjusting the sshloginfile to the below allows for a
                password to be assigned to the individual hosts: 
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                #
                <br>
                # Assign one core for user "gill" on host "192.168.2.26"
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                1/sshpass -p abc123 ssh gill@192.168.2.26
                <br>
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                # Assign four cores for user "john" on host "192.168.4.174"
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                4/sshpass -p abc123 ssh john@192.168.4.174
                <br>
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                # Assign two cores for user "nate" on host "192.168.5.231"
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                2/sshpass -p abc123 ssh nate@192.168.5.231
            </p>

            <p>
                In this case the use of sshpass is specified, and the users
                have been assigned the woefully inadequate password of
                "abc123" for this particular example. Running the previous
                uptime command still returns the uptime of each host.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just from looking at this briefly, I figure there are use
                cases where handling a large number of internal VMs or
                instances which might make parallel an interesting tool.
            </p>

            <p>
                This utility potentially has its uses, and I feel there is
                quite a bit of more that this could be used for. I might
                have to come back and do a further analysis of this at a
                later blog post.
