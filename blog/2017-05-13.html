            <h1>2017-05-13: getting started with zsh</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                Quite a few years have passed since I've used csh or the
                korn shell. The modern Linux distro seems to favour the bash
                shell, and it has become as ubiquitous as the operating
                system itself. Perhaps for good reason, it was the original
                GNU alternative to the bourne shell.
            </p>

            <p>
                As any righteous disciple of the technology will tell you,
                productivity is key to any working environment. Plus crufty
                code that leads to <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)">
                flaws</a> or problems is an everpresent concern. Are there
                maybe alternatives worth considering?
            </p>

            <p>
                One in particular, <a href="https://fishshell.com">fish</a>,
                seemed interesting, but after a short discussion with some
                collegues, they mentioned <a href="www.zsh.org">zsh</a>.
                Admittedly, I wasn't immediately convinced to try it,
                however with several Google searches it appeared that a
                very large number of users swear by it. So why not give it
                a spin?
            </p>

            <p>
                Since we need to overcome the inertia of bash, a bit of
                excitement is needed. Gander at the flashy and illustrious
                prompt themes.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                prompt -p
            </p>

            <p>
                Feels good? Bland shells tend to be a bit of bore and
                I do like the elite2 theme, but each to his own. The
                prompt choice can be made permanent by adding the following
                to the .zshrc file:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                #
                <br>
                # Prompt settings
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                autoload -Uz promptinit
                <br>
                promptinit
                <br>
                prompt elite2 blue
            </p>

            <p>
                Like bash, the zsh allows for a customization of the
                individual components. Doing so is easy, simply add a
                zstyle after autoloading any given part of zsh. In a
                similar vien, for the command completion, I used the
                below settings:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                #
                <br>
                # Command completion settings
                <br>
                #
                <br>
                autoload -U compinit
                <br>
                compinit
                <br>
                zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
                <br>
                zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format '%U%B%d%b%u'
                <br>
                zstyle ':completion:*:warnings' format '%BSorry, no matches for: %d%b'
                <br>
                setopt COMPLETE_ALIASES
            </p>

            <p>
                Now bash can recall commands by means of Ctrl-r, but Zsh can
                also quick recall recently typed commands upon typing a
                letter or two and pressing the up/down arrow. Setting it up
                is harder but definitely recommended, since it can save
                you potentially a couple Ctrl-r keystrokes during the ol'
                daily grind.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">

                <br>
                zle -N up-line-or-beginning-search
                <br>
                zle -N down-line-or-beginning-search
                <br>
                <br>
                [[ -n "$key[Up]"   ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey -- "$key[Up]"   up-line-or-beginning-search
                <br>
                [[ -n "$key[Down]" ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey -- "$key[Down]" down-line-or-beginning-search
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                If you recently typed some long and painfully easy to
                forget command, typing the first few letters of it and
                pressing the up arrow will immediately recall it. Neat,
                eh?
            </p>

            <p>
                Yet the real beauty of zsh is the autocompletion. The bash
                variant is rather tab-tastic; to get the path of a greatly
                nested directory quite a few tab presses are required. With
                zsh you need only fill out the first few letters like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                cd /u/s/v/a/
            </p>

            <p>
                After a single tab press, zsh will convert it to the
                following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                cd /usr/share/vim/addons/
            </p>

            <p>
                Presto! Your directory path is completely filled out. Quite
                the timesaver on very long directory paths. For command
                completion, simply start entering a command like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                sndfile- 
            </p>

            <p>
                The completion settings mentioned earlier set it to the
                'menu' selection mode. So after a simple tab stroke the
                user is presented with a list akin to the below.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                sndfile-
                <br>
                <u>external command</u>
                <br>
                sndfile-cmp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sndfile-deinterleave
                sndfile-metadata-get&nbsp;sndfile-regtest
                <br>
                sndfile-concat&nbsp;&nbsp;sndfile-info&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sndfile-metadata-set&nbsp;sndfile-resample
                <br>
                sndfile-convert&nbsp;sndfile-interleave&nbsp;&nbsp;
                sndfile-play&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                sndfile-salvage
            </p>

            <p>
                Tab again, and then use the arrow keys to select the
                desired choice. Simply enough, and elegant for dealing with
                many different commands at once.
            </p>

            <p>
                Zsh supports the recursive nested file handling natively,
                so if you have a sudden need to view all of the header
                files in a given location, you need only type:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                ls /usr/include/**/*.h
            </p>

            <p>
                Afterwards you will be presented with a list of every
                header present in every folder and subfolder and subfolder
                and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also worth noting is that zsh contains a number of useful
                plugins. One of the fancier official plugins is the syntax
                highlighting. Go ahead an enable it in your zshrc:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                source /usr/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
            </p>

            <p>
                Try and type a command. Wrong command spellings are
                highlighted red whilst correct command spellings are green.
                Certainly helps with those tricky spellings and makes the
                console a bit more Christmas. What's not to love?
            </p>

            <p>
                That covers my take on zsh, and arguably, it does have much
                to offer the average Linux developer or administrator.
                Doubly so considering much of this functionality is present
                without the usual bash hacks or elongated .bashrc files.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Maybe at some later date I might consider a further look
                at zsh functionality, or potentially give the fish shell a
                chance if I get enough people asking about it.
            </p>
