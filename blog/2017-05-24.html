            <h1>2017-05-24: demystifying the obfuscated layers</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                One of the cool / frustrating aspects of low level language
                programming is dealing with the attributes of the OS
                itself. The thought occurred to me that this stuff starts
                to take on an indirect mystical sort of reverence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Perform a calloc blessing of the enigmatic object. Invoke
                the reference of attribute. Set the value of variable.
                Withdraw the memory of reference. End with the rites
                of free, restoring to null.
            </p>

            <p>
                A programmer is a bit like a machine, no?
            </p>

            <p>
                The philosophy de jure endorsed by golang et al. is
                probably the right one. Hide the details and let people get
                down to business.
            </p>

            <p>
                Still, I feel like something is lost from the equation. The
                kernel is a real element functioning off of very real
                hardware. Another layer. That makes it tricky. Speaking of
                hardware tricks...
            </p>

            <p>
                One day I was playing around with the <a
                href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/of?h=v4.12-rc2">
                Device Tree and OpenFirmware</a> module, and I noticed the
                following error messages suddenly appear upon running
                certain unit tests included with the mentioned kernel module:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">

            </p>

            <p>
                Initially I had expected this might be a hardware issue, but I
                quickly ruled that out. Since I was using a custom kernel,
                a fast grep over the code found the answer. There were some
                <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/4/24/1022">
                newly added unit tests</a>, which had a few bugs that were
                more or less immediately
                <a href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1704.3/03541.html">
                patched</a> by the developers who had wrote them.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The warning messages thrown seem to be related to
                <a href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1507.1/04256.html">
                this</a> and so the solution in my case was simply to
                disable the tests and rebuild the kernel. Done and done.
            </p>

            <p>
                Actually kind of amazing how quick progress occurs in a
                project of this size. Frankly impressed there aren't more
                errors, and the code was reasonably clean too.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                I sort of felt motivated to keep exploring. So I glanced
                around at other mild error messages in hopes of gleaming
                a few nifty tidbits, and found this one:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                AMD-Vi: Event logged [ IO_PAGE_FAULT device=09:00.0 
                domain=0x0003 address=0x000000f400089ac0 flags=0x0010 ]
            </p>

            <p>
                This particular log entry, might it have some origin in
                hardware? Or a sad blobby firmware?
            </p>
                
            <p>
                A simple `lspci -v` noted the device in question (09:00.0)
                pointed to an AMD graphics card using the opensource
                amdgpu module.
            </p>

            <p>
                Grepping around the driver directory did not turn up
                too many clues. Some of the error messages were quite
                helpfully verbose, or perhaps the opposite.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                [AVFS] Something is broken. See log!
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Regarding the IO_PAGE_FAULT messages, I noticed quite a number
               of them, one for every group of addresses on that PCIe bus
               of the GPU. A little too convenient to simply be hardware
               errors.
            </p>

            <p>
               Hmmm... well the event was originally printed by a driver
               for the AMD IOMMU. I had hoped there wouldn't be anything
               physically wrong with the component, but at this point
               I thought why not? 
            </p>

            <p>
               Now this one was slightly trickier to pin down, there were
               at least two files "amd_iommu.c" and "amd_iommu_v2.c" that
               looked like they might be important. Possibly more.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               It ended up related to an event being polled on the IOMMU
               itself, printed into the logs by the following code:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               case EVENT_TYPE_IO_FAULT:
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printk("IO_PAGE_FAULT
               device=%02x:%02x.%x"
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"domain=0x%04x address=0x%016llx
               flags=0x%04x]\n",
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCI_BUS_NUM(devid), PCI_SLOT(devid),
               PCI_FUNC(devid),
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domid, address, flags);
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;
            </p>
               
            <p>
               The faults seemed to occur once-in-a-while on bootup, so maybe
               it was related to that?
            </p>
               
            <p>
               I recalled that certain boot functionality on Linux was
               controllable via boot arguments. A dozen hasty searches
               later and I found the <a
               href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt">
               kernel parameters</a> document.
            </p>

            <p>
               As an aside, the online Linux <a
               href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide">
               Admin Guide</a> from Kernel.org is a decent read, abet
               with elements out-of-date or *really* out-of-date. Such is
               the fate of good
               <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/java.rst">
               documentation</a>:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               Linux beats them ALL! While all other OS's are TALKING
               about direct support of Java Binaries in the OS, Linux

            <p>
               Since the IOMMU is point of focus, I glanced at the
               relevant documentation section.

               Oh boy, around here it's not just the memory mapping that's
               sparse. Some of them seem obvious, like 'off' or 'force',
               and I suppose the 'panic' means that if an error or fault
               occurs, then throw in the towel.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               The 'pt' option looks like it means pass-through, and
               a search of the mailing list confirms this. It can be
               accomplished via adding it to your bootloader of choice and
               regenerating the config. In my case, it was grub2:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet iommu=pt"
            </p>
               
            <p>
               After reboot there were no more IO_PAGE_FAULT errors in the
               logs. Problem solved.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               That was kind of exciting. I think I might dig deeper in the
               future to better understand these things. I hope you do too.
