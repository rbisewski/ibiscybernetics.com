            <h1>2018-01-14: building charge with meson - an elementary
            attempt</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                GNU Make is one of the most widely used build systems, and
                over the years I have gotten better at using it despite
                the syntax and lack of good examples. Still I consider it
                to be one of my favourite tools.
            </p>

            <p>
                Actually when compared to a lot of other build systems, it
                can be considered quite elegant. With a little bit (or a
                lot) of effort a repo or a project can build amazing
                complexity. Or break in an unmentionable number of ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                This has inspired a number of other developers to create
                build systems that can meet the needs of the modern
                programmer, ideally with a more documented syntax. As this
                is understandly a hard task, these efforts were focused on
                creating smaller build systems with better code bases.
            </p>

            <p>
                One such example is the
                <a href='http://ninja-build.org'>ninja</a> build system,
                originally conceived to help with the monumental task of
                building and handling the dependencies of the Google Chrome
                browser; its primary focus is speed. For those out of the
                loop, LWN offers a brief and interesting summary 
                <a href='https://lwn.net/Articles/706404'>here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                From my own experience, ninja is a somewhat faster than
                Makefile builds, and its plainer syntax is admittedly
                easier to read. However, this is only half the picture,
                ninja itself is not meant for humans. Instead the goal is
                to offload the generating of the scripts to
                <a href='https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/List-of-generators-producing-ninja-build-files'>
                other tools</a> that allow for meatspace interactivity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Increasingly I have seen inroads within the open source
                community for the <a href="http://mesonbuild.com">meson</a>
                build system, most notably Mesa and GStreamer. Since meson
                is both popular and it uses ninja, I figured worth a shot,
                eh?
            </p>
               
            <p>
                From the man pages:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                Meson is a build system designed to optimize programmer
                productivity. It aims to do this by providing simple,
                out-of-the-box support for modern software development
                tools and practices, such as unit tests, coverage reports,
                Valgrind, CCache and the like.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sounds right fine and dandy, but what can it do? Well I
                find best to jump into these things with no expectations
                and test them out on a small project. Think my tiny
                <a href="https://github.com/rbisewski/sighte">webkit2 browser</a>
                qualifies.
            </p>

            <p>
                The
                <a href="https://github.com/rbisewski/sighte/blob/0804a4b6b7a62afb7a8f03e92b8997757eff4a7d/Makefile">
                Makefile</a> I had been using for this project was by no
                means crufty, but adding new functionality to a Makefile is
                always pain and testing.
            </p>

            <p>
                For meson, everything begins with a meson.build file in the
                main repo directory. After creating one, you'll need to
                specify the project name and lang and any default options.
                Since this is a pure C99 code base, all that's needed is:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                project('sighte','c', default_options : ['c_std=c99'])
            </p>

            <p>
                So for all the C files used for this project, they will be
                forced to the C99 standard. Actually with meson you can set
                the default options of other languages and compilers as
                well, though this is a bit trickier.
            </p>

            <p>
                Moving on I needed some way of setting the version number
                when the build is generated. Originally that was done in
                make via:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                # Version
                <br>
                VERSION = `date +%y.%m`
                <br>
                <br>
                # If unable to grab the version, default to N/A
                <br>
                ifndef VERSION
                <br>
                VERSION = "n/a"
                <br>
                endif
            </p>

            <p>
                Not the fanciest, but it works. In meson though, it can
                simply be treated as a variable.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                version_raw = run_command('date','+%y.%m')
                <br>
                <br>
                if version_raw.returncode() != 0
                <br>
                    version_raw = 'n/a'
                <br>
                endif
                <br>
                <br>
                version = '-D VERSION="' + version_raw.stdout().strip() + '"'
            </p>

            <p>
                Command execution, return code validation, and I can trim
                whitespace? When compared to Makefiles, this feels rather
                elegant. Now I figure that, in theory, there is a Makefile
                way of doing this. Doubt it would be nearly as readable
                though.
            </p>

            <p>
                Managing include paths in Makefiles has always been a bit
                of a pain, and while technically a programmer could use a
                series of pkg-config variables, keeping track of any large
                project is still a bit of a chore. Chances are you've seen
                something like this:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">

                Ah yes, Makefile newlines show their ugly presence. Suppose
                I could concat them all into a single line and make them
                illegible. Considering there are far worse Makefiles I
                really can't complain. What is the meson way of doing it,
                you ask?

                Unbelievable. This is both readable and free of hidden tab
                characters and not-so-hidden Makefile-style newlines. Also
                keep in mind that you may still need to test it out with
                pkg-config beforehand to get the package name correct.
                However, I think you will agree that the meson code is
                likely more maintainable and extensible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Moving on to build targets, for make the code looked
                something like this:

                Not that bad, I believe there are a number of good ways to
                optimize it in make, so this could be improved. In meson
                each of the different build targets have simple
                comma-separated argument arrays, which can help improve
                the readability of the buildfile.

                A tad different than what I am used to, but the plain view
                of the compiler arguments and dependencies feels vast and open
                versus the old Makefile lines. With this code in place my
                meson.build file is more-or-less complete. To build the
                ninja scripts, simply call meson with the name of the
                project whilst in the directory containing the meson.build
                file.

            </p>

            <p>
                For the curious, compare the original
                <a href="https://github.com/rbisewski/sighte/blob/0804a4b6b7a62afb7a8f03e92b8997757eff4a7d/Makefile">
                Makefile</a> and the new
                <a href="https://github.com/rbisewski/sighte/blob/9db6685502e2093638c29340f63774101369667e/meson.build">
                meson.build</a> file. All-in-all I am satisfied with both
                make and meson, as these tool-chains accomplish their goal
                of automating the build process for the developer. Yet it
                has intrigued me enough that alternatives exist that could
                build on (pun intended) the ideas that GNU Make started all
                of those years ago.
            </p>

            <p>
                At some future blog post I may attempt to further explore
                ninja and the other features of meson to a greater degree,
                since I figure there are still many other avenues to check
                out.
