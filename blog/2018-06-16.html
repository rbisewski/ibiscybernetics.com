            <h1>2018-06-16: crafting glyphs with FontForge</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                As an avid opensource user, I tend to do my work exclusively
                on Linux for many years now, where the software tends to
                be both libre and open. This means that there is quite a
                large volume of programs and applications which are
                fairly capable and competitively priced; i.e. free.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recently I was curious about font design, and decided to
                create my own. Years ago I recalled using
                <a href="https://fontforge.github.io">FontForge</a>,
                so it became my first choice.
            </p>

            <p>
                A quick peek at the man page reveals all of the supported
                formats:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                The  program  fontforge  allows  you to create and modify
                font files, accepting input in the following formats (with
                associated file extensions appearing in parentheses).
                <br>
                <br>
                * Glyph Bitmap Distribution (.bdf)
                <br>
                <br>
                * Macintosh resource fonts (.dfont, .bin, .hqx)
                <br>
                <br>
                * OpenType (.otf)
                <br>
                <br>
                * fontforge spline font database (.sfd)
                <br>
                <br>
                * POSTSCRIPT, which includes:
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o ASCII format (.pfa)
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Binary format (.pfb)
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o CID-keyed fonts,
                Adobe convention primarily for Asian characters (.cid, .otf)
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o POSTSCRIPT Type 0 (.ps)
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o POSTSCRIPT Type 3 (.ps)
                <br>
                <br>
                * Scaleable vector graphics fonts (.svg)
                <br>
                <br>
                * TeX bitmap (.pk)
                <br>
                <br>
                * TrueType (.ttf, .ttc)
                <br>
                <br>
                * X11 bitmap (.pcf)
            </p>

            <p>
               So chances are whatever format that is of interest to
               you is likely supported, whether TrueType font or bitmap font
               or SVG font.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Upon running the program, the end-user is presented with the
               following GUI:
            </p>

            <img src="2018-06-16/01.png" />

            <p>
                Admittedly it has began to show its age. I still remember
                that old GUI from the very early 2000s and it has not
                changed too much over the years. Nonetheless, it is one of
                the more feature-rich opensource apps. Those familiar with
                GIMP or other such tools will feel at home after a short
                while.
            </p>

            <p>
                To create a new font, press the "New" button at the bottom,
                otherwise browse and open an existing font. In this case,
                we want to start off with a brand new font. Doing so
                displays the following screen:
            </p>

            <img src="2018-06-16/02.png" />

            <p>
                A bit confusing at first, however, each of those slots is
                an entry for a typographical "glyph". By default, new fonts
                created are set to ISO standard
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">Latin-1</a>,
                which actually covers a broad range of non-Asian
                characters and it applies to most of Western Europe and
                Scandinavia; though some languages like Polish miss out.
            </p>

            <p>
                That said, many other styles are supported, including Unicode
                fonts, though this tutorial will stick to Latin-1 for the
                sake of simplicity.
            </p>

            <p>
                To start drawing, click on one of the [X] boxes below the
                glyph of choice, for example T in this case. Upon doing so
                the following screen will appear:
            </p>

            <img src="2018-06-16/03.png" />

            <p>
                A lack of text labels means that the beginning is just the
                sweet, sweet learning curve. In general, the icons on the
                left-hand-side allow for the drawing of shapes, polygons,
                curves, bezier forms and vertices. At the bottom-left corner
                there are 3 checkboxes to switch the guide, foreground or
                background to on-off.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Quite a few additional options are available via the
                drop-down menu, including bitmap glyphs, width setting
                and bearings. Initially probably only the <i>Element->Font
                Info</i> and <i>Element->Glyph Info</i> are worth pointing
                out since there the font can be renamed and metadata can be
                editted.
            </p>

            <p>
                Going back to the glyph draw screen again, of note is the
                largest square in the middle, surrounded by guide levels.
                This is where the character needs to placed. Let's start
                off with a simple polygon using the rectangle tool. Click
                the small blue rectangle button, and draw out two adjacent 
                shapes in the form of a T as demostrated below.
            </p>

            <img src="2018-06-16/05.gif" />

            <p>
                Note that FontForge has a number of font validation tests
                that it will run as you are drawing out the various glyphs
                you will need for your font. It is strongly recommended you
                take these into account during the font development
                process. If you want, you can have the validation screen
                open continuously while you work, by going back to the main
                font screen and clicking
                <i>Element->Validation->Validate</i>. This will display
                a list of the currently broken glyphs and the specific
                errors in question.
            </p>

            <p>
                The lines and the vertices must not overlap. Zooming in on
                where the rectangles meet shows exactly why; part of the
                lower rectangle is <i>just</i> inside of the upper rectangle.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Select the two top vertices and use the keyboard or mouse
                to move them down.
            </p>

            <img src="2018-06-16/07.gif" />

            <p>
                There, our letter is fixed! With validation being
                satisfied, go back to the main font screen and take a look
                at our whole font thus far.
            </p>

            <img src="2018-06-16/08.png" />

            <p>
                With the capital T glyph complete, what needs to be done
                now is to spend several more hours drawing out all of the
                remaining characters. Good luck!
            </p>
