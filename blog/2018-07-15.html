            <h1>2018-07-15: laser etching at the Winnipeg North Forge makerspace</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                While I work as a software developer in my day job, I am
                also a small businessman and thus curious about companies
                that are in different industries.
            </p> 

            <p> 
                Mechanical engineering and shop-related activities like
                woodcrafting seemed kinda nifty, in the sense of getting to
                build something physical.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've done renovations on houses over the years, so I am
                no stranger to working with my hands, having done quite
                a lot of repairs. Yet I was looking for something more
                than just drilling holes with a press, painting
                or using a glue-gun.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I try to stay up-to-date with the Winnipeg business
                scene, so I looked around at some of the makerspaces and
                other facilities that allow public membership. This place
                called the
                <a href="https://www.northforge.ca/">North Forge</a>
                looked simple enough and they even offered training in
                several types of CNC and laser etching machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lasers are neat, so the device of choice was the 
                <a href="https://www.epiloglaser.com/laser-machines/fusion-laser-series.htm">Epilog Fusion M2-40</a>
                with 120W laser. You can see a picture of it below;
                inspite of website appearance, it is infact rather massive
                in size and requires a bit of skill to use safely.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that the image isn't blurry; this particular machine
                had been through a lot, but otherwise had been holding up
                well over the years.
            </p>

            <p>
               The software supplied with the machine is not dissimilar from
               a standard SVG drawing program, such as Illustrator or
               CorelDraw, and it supports both raster and vector types of
               images: BMP, PNG, JPEG, SVG, etc. Ideally it prefers vector
               graphics since they allow the user to precisely set the
               hairline and tell the laser where to etch or engrave and
               then where to cut.
            </p>

            <img src="2018-07-15/03.png" />

            <p>
                My choice of design was inspired by the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk">Flag of Gda≈Ñsk</a>
                since my family was originally from there and I still have
                relatives who live in the area. It's a neat enough symbol that
                isn't too complex for a first attempt, and could be drawn
                as an SVG in a short timeframe; admittedly I drew my own at
                home so as to save time once I was at the makerspace.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ensuring that the exhaust system was on and that the
                facility was well ventilated, I opened the main door and
                cleaned the three lenses that are used by the laser. The
                instructor then supplied a piece of scrap wood for me to
                practice on.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Fusion supports many types of material, so the laser
                needs to be precisely on the correct setting, lest there be
                potentially overheating of the wood or even damage to the
                servos that move the laser. So the next step required that
                I do a bit of manual reading to determine what parameters
                are actually safe. After inputting those and using the
                small joystick to select the starting point, I send the
                job to console and it started the laser cutting.
            </p>

            <p>
                See the blurriness in the middle? That is where the the
                head was moving across the board at incredible speeds. 
                To begin, I tested out the software to see how the hairline
                settings worked and ended up with this:
            </p>

            <img src="2018-07-15/06.png" />

            <p>
                Alright, so I can draw font and simple shapes now.
                Excellent. Time to move on to testing it with the SVG I
                drew earlier. Following all of the safety procedures, I
                send the image and started up the machine. Afterwards I got
                this:
            </p>

            <p>
                Ouch. Seems I had overdone it and burned part of the wood. In
                addition, the cutlines were in the wrong place and then
                caused the laser to burn gapping holes in the wood at
                the minor details of the crown and small crosses. Though I
                was rather impressed by how accurate it can cut; some of
                those tiny details are less than 1 millimetre.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fixing all of the mistakes from the previous attempt, I
                took a few minutes to clean up the vector graphic and set
                the hairlines to only cut at the edges. Then discovering
                that there is an engrave mode which can cut only a little
                bit into the wood, I decide to try it. My next attempt was
                as follows:
            </p>

            <img src="2018-07-15/08.png" />

            <p>
                Not bad, wouldn't you say? All of the small details were
                etched out quite well, even the tiny bumps on the edges of
                the leaves that are on the top of the crown.
            </p>

            <p>
                So the Epilog Fusion was neat machine to use, and my
                experience with it was good. Thanks again to the North Forge
                for letting me play around with their equipment.

                talented users, were building in the meantime:
