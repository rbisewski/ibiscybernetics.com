            <h1>2018-08-25: a practical introduction to iptables</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
               The well-known and oft-used Linux networking tool, iptables,
               is something that eventually in the career of a Linux
               sysadmin or developer, will require manual configuration.
               From the man page:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               iptables/ip6tables - administration tool for IPv4/IPv6
               packet filtering and NAT
            </p>

            <p>
               In more recent years an IPv6 variant of this tool has been
               implemented, uncreatively denoted <i>ip6tables</i> for the
               sake of simplicity.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Admittedly, filtering IPv6 addresses is perhaps worthy
               of an article itself due to the current prevalence in the
               industry for IPv4 addresses and the commonality of IPv6
               addresses in use among hackers and other smaller online
               communities.
            </p>

            <p>
               Instead, the focus will be on using the original IPv4 variant.
               Start by printing a verbose list of the current filtering
               rules in place on a given host. Type the following into
               a terminal:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                iptables -vL
            </p>

            <p>
               Upon doing so, the various uniquely defined filtering
               groups, called <i>chains</i>, will be printed out with their
               name (e.g. INPUT, OUTPUT) and their policy (e.g. ACCEPT,
               DROP) and their subrules (i.e. for individual IPs or CIDR
               ranges). Specifically, output similar to the below will be
               displayed:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT x packets, y bytes)
               <br>
               pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination 
               <br>
               0 0 ACCEPT all -- any any anywhere anywhere
               <br>
               <br>
               Chain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
               <br>
               pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination 
               <br>
               <br>
               Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT x packets, y bytes)
               <br>
               pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination 
               <br>
               0 0 ACCEPT all -- any any anywhere anywhere
            </p>

            <p>
               Where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the number of packets and
               total size in kilobytes or megabytes, respectively.
               Immediately below the chain definition are the columns
               labels, which are:
            </p>

            <ul class="paragraph_ul">
                <li>
                    pkts - number of packets
                </li>
                <li>
                    bytes - amount in bytes / kilobytes / megabytes
                </li>
                <li>
                    target - what action to take; e.g. ACCEPT packets
                </li>
                <li>
                    prot - the protocol the rule applies to; e.g. udp, tcp, all
                </li>
                <li>
                    opt - IPv4 options for a given rule, if null then --
                </li>
                <li>
                    in - interface used as input; e.g. lo, enp4s0, any 
                </li>
                <li>
                    out - interface used as output; e.g. lo, enp4s0, any 
                </li>
                <li>
                    source - source IP; default is anywhere, i.e. 0.0.0.0/0
                </li>
                <li>
                    destination - destination IP; default is anywhere, i.e. 0.0.0.0/0
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               To add a rule, decide which chain to append to, the
               protocol, the port and the intended action. For example, to
               allow any SSH traffic into the given system, type the
               following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
            </p>

            <p>
               Afterwards, the iptables INPUT chain looks like the following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT x packets, y bytes)
                <br>
                pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination         
                <br>
                0 0 ACCEPT tcp -- any any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:ssh
            </p>

            <p>
               To delete a rule, use the -D flag and type the number of the
               rule, like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
               iptables -D INPUT 1
            </p>

            <p>
               Packets that are incoming from a certain port can be blocked
               as well to prevent traffic from being accessed. This can be
               done by setting the DROP action:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 35353 -j DROP
            </p>

            <p>
               Rules can also be edited by specifying the -I flag with the
               chain and number. Then the other flags may be specified
               alongside to set the different attributes of the rule.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                iptables -I OUTPUT 4 -p tcp -i enp4s0 -j DROP
            </p>

            <p>
               Another action that can be assigned to rules is logging. Say
               you wanted to tweak a rule to allow for a hard limit of 10
               responses from a given IP address per second, and then have
               it log all of the information to file. This can be done as
               follows:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
               iptables -I INPUT 1 -m limit --limit 10/sec -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: " --log-level 7
            </p>

            <p>
               If there are multiple groups of IP addresses that are being
               rate limited for different reasons, consider setting the
               log-prefix to something meaningful than simply the "denied"
               text used above.
            </p>

            <p>
               Now, all of the iptables rules that were implemented will
               by default disappear at the next reboot or shutdown of the
               host. To store these rules more permanently, use the save
               commandline utility as follows to dump it to file:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules
            </p>

            <p>
                The rules will now be loaded on startup. To immediately
                have them loaded, merely restart iptables via systemctl.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                systemctl restart iptables
            </p>

            <p>
                Please note that it is possible to accidently break a
                connected session and be locked out of a system, say if
                the session is connected via <i>ssh</i> and port 22 is now
                blocked. Consider testing the rules file on a non-critical
                local machine first to prevent unforeseen consequences.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you change the rules later on and want to reset them to
                the default, the rules may then be reloaded using the
                restore program like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables/iptables.rules
            </p>

            <p>
                There are quite a few other features in iptables,
                however, this covers all of the basics. Perhaps at some
                later date a post that details further scenarios will be
                written.
