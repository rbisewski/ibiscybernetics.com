               2018-08-26: setting up a minimally simple tunnel with OpenVPN
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
               An essential aspect of networking is the creation of small
               connections, often only a single port or IP address range
               and frequently done in a secure manner. These are called
               tunnels.
            </p>

            <p>
               For implementing a tunnel between two or more networks for
               the purpose spanning between them is referred to as a VPN.
               A popular software tool for this is OpenVPN. As per usual,
               the man page sums up the functionality elegantly:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               openvpn - secure IP tunnel daemon
            </p>

            <p>
                Since OpenVPN is quite configurable and has a vast array of
                feature, the focus here will be on a simple example of
                connecting two hosts. For this example, the addresses of
                the hosts will be 192.168.1.27 and 192.168.1.28
                respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                Begin by creating a simple key, for the sake of the
                example, consider a secret static key to encrypt the tunnel
                connection.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                openvpn --genkey --secret name_of_key
            </p>

            <p>
                By default this will create a 2048-bit static key. Note
                that this type of non-TLS key is quite dangerously insecure,
                but it is useful for running tests on a connection between
                host addresses before an eventual TLS server is setup.
            </p>

            <p>
                Go ahead and copy both of the servers using a program such
                as scp:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                scp -i ~/.ssh/id_name /path/to/name_of_key user@192.168.1.27:/upload/dir/
            </p>

            <p>
                To begin, on the 192.168.1.27 host, the start and end of
                the tunnel can be specified using the --ifconfig flag. The
                starting IP address of this host can be itself and the
                tunnel end can be the other host, 192.168.1.28. For the
                sake of simpilicity, call the device `tun1` for tunnel 1
                and set a high-ish verbosity of level 5.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                openvpn --dev tun1 --ifconfig 192.168.1.27 192.168.1.28 --verb 5 --secret name_of_key
            </p>

            <p>
                On the 192.168.1.28 host do the same, swapping the start
                and end tunnel IP addresses, like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                openvpn --dev tun1 --ifconfig 192.168.1.28 192.168.1.27 --verb 5 --secret name_of_key
            </p>

            <p>
                With this complete, the tunnel should be active and
                accepting connections. Do a quick check using the <i>ip</i>
                command, and then test it using <i>ping</i> or <i>mtr</i>.
                Try this out on both hosts; for the 192.168.1.128 host, it
                would be something like this:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                ip a
                <br>
                ping 192.168.1.27
                <br>
                mtr 192.168.1.27
            </p>

            <p>
                If the other host responds, then the tunnel was setup
                correctly. Please note that this should not be used as a
                permanent solution since it is quite insecure.
            </p>

            <p>
                If this fails, then consider taking a brief look at
                iptables or other firewall software and determine if
                perhaps a rule is blocking the device or IP.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                iptables -vL
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point, various small networking tests (e.g. of a
                log reader or web app) could be done before setting up
                a TLS server and signed key with certificate authority.
            </p>

            <p>
                That more-or-less demostrates how to quickly setup a tunnel
                between two hosts using OpenVPN. Quite a lot of features
                could use an article in of themselves, especially with
                regards to fine-tuning of the config file.
            </p>

            <p>
                With this in mind, there is a new technology that will
                eventually be bundled with the Linux kernel, WireGuard.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that as of the writing of this article, WireGuard is
                still considered bleeding-edge and thus may not yet be
                production ready. In a few years, however, it will likely
                become mainstream due to its simple configuration and fast
                speed when compared to older VPN technology.
