               2018-08-31: taking kubernetes for a spin - a short primer
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
               In the realm of modern software development, web based
               applications are often key to the growth and success of a
               company. In order to meet the demands of rapid feature
               implementation, a number of frameworks have appeared to
               allow developers to quickly create whatever is needed and
               replace or remove other elements with ease.
            </p>

            <p>
               One unfortunate consequence of this is that quite a lot of
               these technologies were done under the assumption that CPU
               speed or efficiency or parallelism would continue for many
               more decades. In recent times the limits of silicon
               transistors and photolithography mean that on-going speed
               improvements are restricted to multi-threading, either on
               multi-processor CPUs or clusters of GPUs.
            </p>

            <p>
               With this in mind, several attempts have been made to make
               code libraries which take advantage of these clusters.
               Another approach is to horizontially scale via
               virtualization and containerization.
            </p>

            <p>
               Containers do have limits, mostly related to performance and
               occasional memory corruption, yet they can be useful since
               they have many unique aspects. They can be more-or-less
               fully separated from the main operating system and are able
               to be near-perfect clones of whatever instance they are
               derived from.
            </p>

            <p>
               A recent application of note is <i>docker</i>, a
               containerization app that allows developers to spin up quick
               instances to develop programs with litte to no risk to the
               OS, or even test multiple Linux distros or versions of a
               distro, should the developer require this.
            </p>

            <p>
               Since the inception of docker, Google had been attempting to
               extend this functionality of the containers to allow web
               applications to have better scalability and durability. The
               end result is <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a>,
               often abbreviated as K8s. From Wikipedia:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system
               for automating deployment, scaling and management of
               containerized applications.
            </p>

            <p>
               Essentially, K8s is a tool to assist with handling a large
               cluster of instances, for one or more applications or
               servers. Specifically, this does differ from docker in a few
               interesting ways:
            </p>

            <ul class="paragraph_ul">
                <li>
                    scale directly based on CPU usage and availability
                </li>
                <li>
                    automated rollout and rollback of instances, in the
                    style of subversioning or staging systems
                </li>
                <li>
                    orchestration; allows mounting of remote storage
                    via providers such as Google Cloud or AWS
                </li>
                <li>
                    self healing, it can attempt to replace or reschedule
                    applications or instances that fail
                </li>
                <li>
                    uses internal private IP addresses, negating the need
                    for complicated network topologies
                </li>
                <li>
                    utilizes templated configuration files, similar to Chef
                    it allows a DevOps work environment
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               So if your web application is written with containerization
               paradigm in mind then it could plausibly scale well based on
               workload, have a limited ability to repair or recover from
               errors or corruption, and have some level of cloud
               redundancy.
            </p>

            <p>
               While that does sound complex, it is more than a bit
               intriguing due to all of the services it can potentially
               replace. With that in mind, begin by ensuring the machine
               that will run Kubernetes supports hardware virtualization
               and that it is enabled in the BIOS and operating system.
            </p>

            <p>
               Afterwards, install kubectl and minikube via
               <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/">
               the official documentation</a>. Both are required to
               actually run the full suite, along with docker as well.
            </p>

            <p>
               To summarize, kubectl allows management and fine tuning of a
               kubernetes cluster while minikube allows for easy spin up
               instances to make it easier during development.
            </p>

            <p>
               With all of the components installed, start minikube via the
               following command:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                minikube start
            </p>

            <p>
                If this works, then this will start up a kubernetes server
                on the current server. In the event none of the typical VM
                drivers appear to function, set the VM driver to none, as
                shown below. Later on, consider installing VirtualBox and
                utilizing that to create instances if KVM is unavailable.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                minikube start --vm-driver none
            </p>

            <p>
                If that worked, then a minikube resource should have
                started, and now thus it can be managed via kubectl. To
                ensure it actually started, do a quick check like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                kubectl get nodes
            </p>

            <p>
                The output from that command will resemble something like
                the following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                NAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                STATUS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ROLES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                AGE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                VERSION
                <br>
                minikube&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Ready&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                master&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                13h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                v1.10.0
            </p>

            <p>
                The minikube node is now available and can be adjusted and
                configured, both via web browser and via commandline
                interface. To enable the web interface, type the following
                command:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                minikube dashboard
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon doing so, the kubernetes interface will appear in the
                browser and allow access to the create pods and adjust
                configuration settings of the given minikube instance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feel free to browse through the various options and pages.
                Of note are the lists of nodes and pods on this k8s server.
                Since a minikube node is active, it is possible to spawn
                individualized containers on it, called pods. Typically
                these are designed to run a single command or microservice
                or child process.
            </p>

            <p>
                To test out if the pod creation process is working, there
                is an image from the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/">
                Google Cloud Container Registry</a> labelled
                <i>echoserver</i> which mimics whatever is thrown at it.
                Useful for making the "Hello, world!" equivalent of a pod.
                To do so, take advantage of the <i>use</i> feature of kubectl
                to download the container image:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                kubectl run hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4 --port=8080
            </p>

            <p>
                Assuming this ran as intended, a pod will be created with
                the name <i>hello-minikube</i>, which can be viewed either
                via CLI or web browser. To obtain the list of pods via
                commandline, do the following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                kubectl get pods
            </p>

            <p>
                Which yields output similar to the following:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
                NAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                STATUS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                RESTARTS&nbsp;&nbsp;
                AGE
                <br>
                hello-minikube-6c47c66d8-2bhml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;

            <p>
                In the web browser, it can be found via the Workloads &gt;
                Pods &gt; hello-minikube-hex-timestamp. That page shows the
                node, status and the current quality of service, among
                other details:
