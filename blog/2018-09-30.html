               2018-09-23: getting a handle on zettabytes with ZFS 
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
               All systems need storage and modern business, especially in
               companies with many employees or complex mathematical and
               scientific data. Often this means a number of large files
               and requires a considerable amount of hard disk storage.
            </p>

            <p>
               Existing RAID configurations demand significant hardware,
               and some like RAID5, feature so-called "write holes" that
               can painfully degrade performance and associated
               consequences upon a disk failure. RAID6 can reduce quite a
               lot of this, but it requires even more physical drives.
            </p>

            <p>
               Given that the pace of development of disk firmware tends to
               be faster than the physical hardware, frequently even disks
               that feature the same physical platters can have different
               firmware version and features. Hence to truly ensure that
               the desired RAID is both safe and that no unforeseen minor
               incompatibilities occur, a company is often forced to
               invest in purchasing several additional spares up-front.
            </p>

            <p>
               Multiple attempts to find alternatives to RAID tended to be
               very platform dependant or vendor specific, so they tended
               to not be widely adopted by the industry. The largest and
               most popular of these was ZFS from Sun Microsystems, while
               on the Linux side there was an attempt with the Btrfs file
               system. Neither were terribly ideal since ZFS was closed
               source and Btrfs has been in an extended beta since 2007.
            </p>

            <p>
               Then in 2013 the OpenZFS group was able to fork the code
               base due to the fact that Sun Microsystems had been
               purchased by Oracle and opensourced the Solaris operating
               system. Modern storage needs for big systems use this open
               and feature-rich version of ZFS. From wikipedia:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace">
               ZFS is scalable, and includes extensive protection against
               data corruption, support for high storage capacities,
               efficient data compression, integration of the concepts of
               filesystem and volume management, snapshots and
               copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and
               automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very
               precisely configured.
            </p>

            <p>
                The feature list above is rather overwhelming, however, ZFS
                is designed to make it easy to manage a diverse storage
                ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
                A word of caution to the reader; the ZFS code base uses the
                CDDL license which is not compatible with the GPL license of
                the Linux kernel. Ergo, you will either need to find a distro
                that has a pluggable pre-built dkms module (e.g. Ubuntu) or
                attempt to build the code yourself and then make a Linux
                kernel that works with that ZFS version; thus ZFS versions
                will <i>not</i> always work with any given Linux kernel.
            </p>

            <p>
                ZFS works by means of storage pools, which are fundamently
                groups of hard drives that all interact with each other.
                Disks in another pool cannot influence with inside of a given
                pool. At any time, existing drives can be removed or new
                drives attached to the pool.
            </p>

            <p>
                To create a pool, use the create command with a desired
                name, the RAID type and a list of devices to attach to the
                pool. For this example, we create a RAID-1 style mirrored
                list using drives by-id, call it example_pool.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zpool create example_pool mirror \ 
                <br>
                /dev/disk/by-id/ata-SERIAL_NUMBER_12345 \ 
                <br>
                /dev/disk/by-id/ata-SERIAL_NUMBER_23456
            </p>

            <p>
                The mirrors created by ZFS tend to be very robust and while
                other RAID styles are possible, they are much less
                flexible. A basic overview of some of the more interesting
                commands are demonstrated below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Create a volume:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zfs create name_of_pool/volume0
            </p>

            <p>
                Tell ZFS to start on boot-up:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                systemctl enable zfs.target
                <br>
                systemctl start zfs.target
                <br>
                systemctl enable zfs-import-cache
                <br>
                systemctl enable zfs-mount
                <br>
                systemctl enable zfs-import.target
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider scrubbing the pool at least once a week to ensure
                proper caching performance:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zpool scrub name_of_pool
            </p>

            <p>
                Create, list, rollback, clone and destroy snapshots:
            <p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zfs snapshot name_of_pool/volume1@123456
                <br>
                sudo zfs list -t snapshot -o name,creation
                <br>
                sudo zfs rollback -r name_of_pool/volume1@123456
                <br>
                sudo zfs clone name_of_pool/volume1@21082011 name_of_pool/volume1_restore
                <br>
                sudo zfs destroy name_of_pool/volume1@123456
            </p>

            <p>
                Split the pool, either to create new separate pools or to
                replace disks:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zpool split name_of_pool name_of_brand_new_pool \
                <br>
                /dev/ata-SERIAL_NUMBER_23456
            </p>

            <p>
                Attach a new drive to a pool with an existing device:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zpool attach name_of_pool \
                <br>
                /dev/ata-SERIAL_NUMBER_of_existing_device \
                <br>
                /dev/ata-SERIAL_NUMBER_of_brand_new_hdd
            </p>

            <p>
                Check history of all of the pools or of a given pool:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zpool history
            </p>

            <p>
                Monitor the current I/O of a pool, every 6 seconds:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo zpool iostat 6
            </p>

            <p>
                As an aside, you can also mix-and-match hard drives of
                multiple sizes.
            </p>

            <p>
                For interest, if you have a set of mechanical platter drives
                and SSD with an operating system installed, you could
                preserve your data by making the SSD the first drive of a pool
                and then attach mechanical drives as a mirror.
            </p>

            <p>
                That covers most of the important commands of ZFS, however,
                there are still quite a lot of other features available.
                Consider reading the man page if you are curious.
