               2018-12-29: preparing Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 for the Raspberry Pi 3B+
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
               The Raspberry Pi 3B+ was the leading version of the small
               yet effective computer system in 2018. While it was not too
               large a change from the previous Pi 3B, it introduced a number
               of minor firmware changes that broke support for existing OS images.
            </p>

            <p>
               Since the current phase of my career features quite a lot of
               system administration duties, small computers like the Pi make
               it easy to run simple tasks in a non-containerized environment.
            </p>

            <p>
               However I was recently dismayed during my attempts to migrate
               the SD cards from Pi 3B to 3B+ resulted in a litany of errors.
               In addition, there was no meaningful upgrade path from Ubuntu
               16.04 to 18.04 on the Pi since quite a lot of people use the
               standard Raspian so everything else tends to be out of date.
            </p>

            <p>
               Understandably, many clients however prefer having the
               maximum possible compatibility with desktop Ubuntu LTS, so
               I was forced to do some more digging.
            </p>

            <p>
               An image of Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS for the Raspberry Pi 3B exists
               and can be found
               <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04/release/">here</a>,
               however, it does not support some minor variants of 3B, notably
               the 3B+ is not supported.
            </p>

            <p>
               Looking at the Raspberry Pi spec sheets carefully, I figured
               since the physical CPU had not changed between 3B and 3B+ that
               there was no Linux limitation against it working. So I
               proceeded to write the image to the SD card as per usual:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo unxz ubuntu-18.04.2-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi3.img.xz
                <br>
                <br>
                sudo dd if=ubuntu-18.04.2-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi3.img \
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of=/dev/sdc bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress
            </p>

            <p>
               I plugged that into my Pi and, sadly, it was unable to boot.
               It remained stuck at the rainbow colour palette startup
               screen. So my guess was the bootloader had failed somehow.
            <p>

            <p>
               Plugging the SD back into my desktop, I did a lsblk to
               determine /boot partition location. Then I did a ls to see what
               what files were present. Mostly firmware blobs and vmlinuz and
               the infamous config.txt which controls the Pi boot process. So
               I opened it with vim noticed that kernel was pointing to a
               uboot file which was not present. Bingo!
            </p>

            <p>
               Thankfully the Broadcom CPU used in the Pi has been pushed
               to kernel upstream, which is what Ubuntu LTS relies on, so I
               could just delete the device_tree_address line used by
               u-boot and adjust several lines in the config.txt to point
               to the plain ol' Linux vmlinuz.
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                kernel=vmlinuz
                <br>
                initramfs initrd.img followkernel
                <br>
                arm_control=0x200
                <br>
                device_tree_address=0x0200000 # -- delete this line --
            </p>

            <p>
               As an aside, I noticed many of the Raspberry Pi blobs for the
               other devices were missing. So if you need those, you'll want
               to obtain them via the official
               <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot">GitHub repo</a>.
               In my case I only needed the ComputeModule3 blob, which is
               bcm2710-rpi-cm3.dtb, so I copied that into the boot partition.
            </p>

            <p>
               With that, my Raspberry Pi 3B+ was able to boot the latest
               Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS. Since this is Ubuntu, the normal username
               and password combo is 'ubuntu' for both, and I was able to
               login just fine.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Finally, for a 4-core computer with only 1GB of RAM, the
               commandline use was quite fast and it didn't need more than
               about 150Mb at any given time. I was able to trim that by
               quite a bit removing the cloud-init services and got it down
               to about 110Mb.
            </p>

            <p>
               Thus I was able to use the humble Raspberry Pi for
               semi-important business goals and so wraps up this blog post.
