               Game development and game engines tend to require a lot of
               parallel processing power in order to run any significantly
               complex rendered scenes. This is a consequence of the fact
               that the building blocks consist of simple triangles, along
               with a variety of other systems, such as particle effects
               and in-game physics.

               Vector arithmetic is very common, typically for determining
               line location and length, or the relative location of a point
               for a given set of points. For vectors that consist of a
               single vertex of the style of (x,y,z), the simplest operations
               of addition and subtraction apply like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
               (1,2,3) + (0,2,2) = (1,4,5)
               <br>
               (1,2,3) - (0,2,2) = (1,0,1)
            </p>

            <p>
               For multiple line vectors, basic knowledge of geometry and
               trigonometry of the angles apply. Some simple visualizations:

               Vector dot product values are useful for many things, such as
               calculating diffuse lighting or player position relative to
               another character. Specifically, a vector dot product is a
               mathematical operation on two vectors, which returns a number.
               Typically it is written as...
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                dot product = u . v
            </p>

            <p>
               A good way to visualize this is as follows:
            </p>

            <p>
               Vector cross products are also operations on two vectors,
               wherein the result is a third vector which is perpendicular to
               the first two and has a length that is an average of both
               lengths. These are quite useful for a number of applications,
               notably collision detections; e.g. between the player and the
               wall, the cross product vector would be the "adjusted" path
               that the player would take due to the wall colliding. Typically
               they are written as:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                cross product = u x v
            </p>

            <p>
               This can be visualized as follows, where the blue line is the
               cross product:
