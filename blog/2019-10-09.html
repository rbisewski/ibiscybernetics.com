               Game development and game engines tend to require a lot of
               parallel processing power in order to run any significantly
               complex rendered scenes. This is a consequence of the fact
               that the building blocks consist of simple triangles, along
               with a variety of other systems, such as particle effects
               and in-game physics.

               Vector arithmetic is very common, typically for determining
               line location and length, or the relative location of a point
               for a given set of points. For vectors that consist of a
               single vertex of the style of (x,y,z), the simplest operations
               of addition and subtraction apply like so:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
               (1,2,3) + (0,2,2) = (1,4,5)
               <br>
               (1,2,3) - (0,2,2) = (1,0,1)
            </p>

            <p>
               For multiple line vectors, basic knowledge of geometry and
               trigonometry of the angles apply. Some simple visualizations:

               Vector dot product values are useful for many things, such as
               calculating diffuse lighting or player position relative to
               another character. Specifically, a vector dot product is a
               mathematical operation on two vectors, which returns a number.
               Typically it is written as...
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                dot product = u . v
            </p>

            <p>
               A good way to visualize this is as follows:
            </p>

            <img src="2019-10-09/02.png" />

            <p>
               Vector cross products are also operations on two vectors,
               wherein the result is a third vector which is perpendicular to
               the first two and has a length that is an average of both
               lengths. These are quite useful for a number of applications,
               notably collision detections; e.g. between the player and the
               wall, the cross product vector would be the "adjusted" path
               that the player would take due to the wall colliding. Typically
               they are written as:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                cross product = u x v
            </p>

            <p>
               This can be visualized as follows, where the blue line is the
               cross product:
            </p>

               Matrix math is related to the vector arithmetic, with some of
               the more interesting applications being related to HLSL or GLSL
               shaders. In addition they can be used for handling bounding
               boxes or bounding sphere since subtracting matrixes of the
               length or radius makes multidimensional concerns simpler. Some
               typical examples of the variety used in game development might
               be as below:

            When it comes to the concept of collisions,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box">bounding boxes</a>
            are an important concept since they...
