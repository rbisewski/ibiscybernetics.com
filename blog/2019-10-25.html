               2019-10-25: common tree data structures in programming
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                Tree structures have the advantage that they are able to
                organize (and potentially sort) large quantities of
                information by featuring nodes that branch out from some
                central starting point, and do so in a formulaic way. In
                particular there are many types of trees, including the
                B and A-B and R-B and Monte Carlo; along with search
                patterns like A*.
            </p>

            <p>
                B-trees are tree structures that self-balance / self-sort and
                are designed in such a way as to allow for searches, access,
                insertions and deletions in logarithmic time. Typically they
                are used for situations that need to read and write large
                blocks of data, like databases or filesystems.
            </p>

            <p>
                A-B trees are structures that have all of their leaves at the
                same depth and all internal nodes (except for the root) have
                between "a" and "b", where 2 &lt;= a &lt;= (b+1) / 2. The root
                has (if it is not a leaf) has between 2 and b children.
            </p>

            <p>
                A red-black tree is similar in concept to the B-tree in that
                it is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Most
                notably each node contains an extra bit that stores whether it
                is "red" or "black". The purpose of the colour is to ensure
                that the tree remains balanced during insertion and deletions.
                This feature constrains how unbalanced a tree can become in
                the worse case scenario, and admittedly while the algorithm is
                not perfect, it will nonetheless yield a search or insertion
                or deletion operation in O(n log n) time.
