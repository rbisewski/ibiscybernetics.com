               2019-11-02: common tree data structures in programming
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                Tree structures have the advantage that they are able to
                organize (and potentially sort) large quantities of
                information by featuring nodes that branch out from some
                central starting point, and do so in a formulaic way. In
                particular there are many types of trees, including the
                B and A-B and R-B; along with search patterns like A* and
                the Monte Carlo tree search.
            </p>

            <p>
                B-trees are tree structures that self-balance / self-sort and
                are designed in such a way as to allow for searches, access,
                insertions and deletions in logarithmic time. Typically they
                are used for situations that need to read and write large
                blocks of data, like databases or filesystems.
            </p>

            <p>
                A-B trees are structures that have all of their leaves at the
                same depth and all internal nodes (except for the root) have
                between "a" and "b", where 2 &lt;= a &lt;= (b+1) / 2. The root
                has (if it is not a leaf) has between 2 and b children.
            </p>

            <p>
                A red-black tree is similar in concept to the B-tree in that
                it is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Most
                notably each node contains an extra bit that stores whether it
                is "red" or "black".
            </p>

            <p>
                In a red-black tree, the purpose of the colour is to ensure
                that the tree remains balanced during insertion and deletions.
                This feature constrains how unbalanced a tree can become in
                the worse case scenario, and admittedly while the algorithm
                is not perfect, it will nonetheless yield a search or
                insertion or deletion operation in O(n log n) time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The A* searching is a graph traversal and path search
                algorithm which is a best-first search that is formulated
                in terms of weighted graphs. Starting from a specific node
                of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node
                having the smallest distance or shortest time.
            </p>

            <p>
                When implementing A* searching, a feature to consider is that
                this algorithm works by maintaining a tree structure of paths
                originating at the start node and extending these paths one
                edge at a time untils its termination criterion is
                satisfied; e.g. a certain distance or value.
            </p>

            <p>
                Monte Carlo tree search is a heuristic search algorithm for
                decisioning, often used as part of an AI implementation in
                video games. Most famously it was used by Google Deepmind for
                their AlphaGo software.
            </p>

            <p>
                In particular the Monte Carlo tree search relies on the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monto Carlo method</a>
                which when combined with a search tree algorithm, allows for
                a way to store past and previous decisions in order to yield
                recursive rollout and backtracking and adaptive sampling
                choices for the final decision made by the AI.
