               2020-09-17: a brief overview of OpenStack
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                Several independent cloud companies depend on a unique
                operating system that allows sysadmins to take advantage of
                the numerous resources that might be present in a datacentre,
                notably compute power or storage or networking capability.
            </p>

            <p>
                Called <a href="https://www.openstack.org/software/">OpenStack</a>
                it allows for many of the features that one might expect from
                GCP, AWS, or Azure. A summary of some of the components are
                listed below:
            </p>

            </ul>

            <p>
                Of note are the Zun Capsules, which is roughly equal to
                Kubernetes Pods, which use Neutron as the networking
                component, and Cinder as the block storage. This allows for
                a Kubernetes-like environment similar to other Cloud vendors.
