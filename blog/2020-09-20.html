               2020-09-20: examining the different Kubernetes network technologies
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                Kubernetes itself relies on network plugins in order to allow
                pods to talk to each other and also to communicate through the
                kube proxy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generally there are two types; the first type are
                CNI plugins which align with the the appc or CNI spec and
                designed for interoperability; the second type are kubenet
                plugins which merely implement a basic <i>cbr0</i> via the
                <i>bridge</i> and <i>host-local</i> CNI plugins.
            </p>

            <p>
                These days the Kubernetes cluster networking plugin is quite diverse, and a number of providers as detailed
                <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/">here</a> allow for a great
                many more features than even a few years ago and much more than docker ever could.
            </p>

            <p>
                A list of the various network types and the more commonly used plugins are detailed below:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>noop:</span>
                    <span>
                        default if no kubelet network plugin, sets <i>net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables=1</i>
                        to allow Docker bridge-like networking via iptables
                    </span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <span>kubenet:</span>
                    <span>an incredibly basic network plugin on Linux, typically for clusters with a single node</span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <span>cni:</span>
                    <span>
                        container network interface; supports hostPort for exposing ports on the nodes, and
                        also traffic shaping to set the bandwidth on pod ingress and egress
                    </span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <span>flannel:</span>
                    <span>a CNI plugin that is a very simple layer 3 network fabric for Kubernetes with a minimal featureset</span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <span>calico:</span>
                    <span>
                        a CNI plugin that is a highly scalable networking and network policy solution, very feature rich and
                        conceptionally similar to the IP network traffic found on the internet between pods; it is deployed
                        without encapsulation or overlays to provide high-performance and high-scale datacentre networking.
                    </span>
                </li>
            </ul>
