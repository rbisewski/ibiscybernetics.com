               2022-05-03: using awslogs to send EC2 logs to CloudWatch
            </h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                CloudWatch is a convenient way to store logs in AWS, especially
                in Cloud-centric application design.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes this may mean interacting with virtual machine
                compute instances, such as EC2, but might also include
                baremetal servers too.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, ssh to the desired server and do the following and
                obtain the awslogs agent:
            </p>

            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cloudwatch/downloads/latest/awslogs-agent-setup.py -O
            </p>

            <p>
                Next run the agent install setup, and if this is an EC2 instance,
                select a region as well using the --region flag.
            </p>
                
            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo python ./awslogs-agent-setup.py --region us-west-2
            </p>
                
            <p>
                At this point the installer might ask you a bunch of questions,
                in particular the following.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>aws key:</span>
                    <span>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>aws secret:</span>
                    <span>
                        secret value from the AWS role mentioned above
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>hostname:</span>
                    <span>
                        either the full qualified domain name or the name of the server

                <li>
                    <span>datetime:</span>
                    <span>
                        offers multiple formats, including year-month-day or month-day
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>logfile:</span>
                    <span>
                        path to the file to monitor and send data to CloudWatch
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>position:</span>
                    <span>
                        either send entire log to CloudWatch from beginning or
                        upload contents appended to end of file
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>stream:</span>
                    <span>
                        name of the log entry in CloudWatch
                    </span>
                </li>
            </ul>
                
            <p>
                After all of the questions have been answer, then the awslogs
                service will start and the contents of the log in question will
                be sent.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Check the status of the server using either service or systemctl:
            </p>
                
            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo service awslogs status
                <br><br>
                [or]
                <br><br>
                sudo systemctl status awslogs
            </p>

            <p>
                Afterwards edit the awslogs config:
            </p>
                
            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo vim /var/awslogs/etc/awslogs.conf
            </p>

            <p>
                The content of this file should resemble:
            </p>
                
            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                [/var/log/nginx/access.log]
                <br>
                datetime_format = %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S
                <br>
                file = /var/log/nginx/access.log
                <br>
                buffer_duration = 5000
                <br>
                log_stream_name = /var/log/nginx/access.log
                <br>
                initial_position = end_of_file
                <br>
                log_group_name = /aws/ec2/hostname.of.ec2
            </p>

            <p>
                Then restart the awslogs service, using the method relevant to
                the Linux distribution present on the EC2 instance or server;
                typically one of these commands:
            </p>
                
            <p class="grey_monospace_code">
                sudo service awslogs restart
                <br><br>
                [or]
                <br><br>
                sudo systemctl restart awslogs
            </p>

            <p>
                This will result in the logs being sent to AWS CloudWatch,
                which can be found under the log group name of
                /aws/ec2/hostname.of.ec2, with a steam name of
                /var/log/nginx/access.log.
